INT. LIVING ROOM – NIGHT
The room is dimly lit. JILL (25) sits on the couch, laptop open, focused on her work. Her partner, ALEX (27), enters the room, visibly upset. Alex sits down next to JILL, trying to collect their thoughts.

ALEX: (Taking a deep breath) Jill can we talk? I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed lately.

JILL continues typing, not looking up from her laptop.

JILL: (Slightly distracted) What’s going on?

ALEX: I don’t know… work’s been really stressful, and I just feel like everything is piling up. I can’t keep up. I’ve been anxious for weeks.

JILL stops typing but still doesn’t look up.

JILL: (Matter-of-fact) Well, you’ve got to figure out a way to manage it. Maybe you need to break down the tasks and prioritize. Have you thought about organizing your workload better?

ALEX: (Sighs, frustrated) It’s not just about the work, Jill. It’s… I don’t know, everything. I just need to talk it out.

JILL: (Raising an eyebrow, now looking at Alex) Okay, but talking it out isn’t going to fix the problem. What do you want me to say? You need a solution, not to keep focusing on the negative.

ALEX:  (Slightly hurt) I’m not asking for a solution. I just need… I don’t know, some support. I feel like I’m falling apart, and I just want you to understand that.

JILL: (Shrugs, a bit impatient) I get that, but the way I see it, you need to focus on fixing things instead of feeling overwhelmed. If you break down the problem logically, it won’t seem so big.

Alex turns away, trying to compose themselves. There’s a moment of silence as Alex looks down, frustrated.
