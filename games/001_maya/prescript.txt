INT. KITCHEN – SATURDAY MORNING
The sun shines through the window. MAYA (late 20s, warm-hearted, always busy) hums softly to herself as she sets the table. Pancakes, fresh coffee, and fruit are all perfectly arranged. She takes a moment to admire her work, a smile spreading across her face.

MAYA: (quietly, to herself) This is going to be perfect.

She hears footsteps approaching. ALEX (late 20s, laid-back, reserved) walks in, hair messy, still waking up. They glance at the spread with a sleepy smile.

ALEX: Morning.

ALEX grabs a cup of coffee and takes a seat. They drink without much reaction. MAYA stands by, waiting expectantly for a response. The silence lingers.

MAYA: Do you like it?

ALEX nods, still groggy.

ALEX: Yeah, it’s great. Thanks.

MAYA’s smile falters ever so slightly. She turns to sit down, stirring her coffee absentmindedly. A beat of silence passes.

INT. LIVING ROOM – LATER THAT DAY
MAYA is folding laundry on the couch, her movements slower than usual. ALEX is sitting nearby, scrolling on their phone. The energy is low, something unsaid hanging in the air.

ALEX: (looking up) Is something wrong?

MAYA hesitates, folding a shirt a bit too carefully.
